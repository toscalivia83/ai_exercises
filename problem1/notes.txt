This exercise was in my opinion pretty well described, even if I think the "number" and the "iterator" described make it a little bit more complex to understand.
I was a bit confused at the beginning on which one was which.
Fortunately the examples helped !

I think having been able to make a code concise and descriptive enough following the steps.

If I had to improve something, I would start by simplifying the code to have a better performance.
That's probably possible to avoid doing all these loops, but I couldn't find the solution right now without too much time.

How to run:
npm i
node index.js [fileName]
